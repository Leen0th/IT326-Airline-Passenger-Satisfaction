# IT326-Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction

  <h1>Project Information</h1>

  <h2>Project Title | Analyzing Airline Passenger Satisfaction: Identifying Key Factors for Enhanced Travel Experiences</h2>
  
  <h3>Project Motivation | </h3>
  
  <p>In today's highly competitive airline industry, understanding passenger satisfaction is crucial for maintaining a loyal customer base and gaining a competitive edge. <p>

  <p>We wanted to work on this dataset because we want to understand exactly what factors contribute to passenger satisfaction. With a bunch of data about different parts of the flying experience, we're ready to uncover what really matters to passengers. Our aim is to find insights that can help airlines do a better job of keeping their customers satisfied.</p>

  <h3>Students Involved |</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Leen Alotaibi</li>
    <li>Raseel Aldawish</li>
    <li>Leen Alqahtani</li>
    <li>Shooq Aldawsari</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Classification |</h3>
  <p> Predicting Customer Satisfaction, where we will attemp to create a model that predicts whether a customer was Satisfied or Unsatisfied with the experience and/or service which an airline provided.</p>

  <h3>Clustering |</h3>
  <p> Clustering customer survey responses involves grouping similar data points based on common characteristics to establish distinct clusters. Different techniques will be employed to identify the optimal 
      number of clusters that align with our dataset. Subsequently, evaluation methods will be applied to gauge the efficacy of these clusters in effectively categorizing survey responses based on their intrinsic 
      features, facilitating insightful predictions and analysis.</p>

  <h3>Defect Prediction |</h3>
   <p>Defect prediction in a dataset of customer survey responses involves identifying potential issues or anomalies within the collected data. This process encompasses the detection of inconsistencies or 
      irregularities in survey responses, including the identification of missing or unreliable data points, which can impact the reliability of the dataset. By employing advanced data analysis techniques, defect 
      prediction aims to enhance the overall quality and dependability of the dataset, ensuring it accurately captures the intended information from survey participants. This proactive approach reduces the risk 
      of generating misleading or unreliable outcomes when utilizing the dataset for subsequent tasks and applications, such as predictive modeling or trend analysis based on customer feedback.</p>
