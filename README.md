  <h2>Project Title: Analyzing Accidents for Improved Safety</h2>
  
  <h3>Project Motivations: Making Roads Safer with Data</h3>
  <p>Understanding why accidents happen is super important for making roads safer.</p>

  <p>We decided to work on this problem because we care about keeping people safe on the road. We want to find out why accidents happen and what we can do to stop them. We'll look for connections between different things like the weather, the time of day, and where the accidents happen. Our goal is to find useful insights that can help make roads safer for everyone. We're eager to use this data to make a positive difference in our communities.</p>
